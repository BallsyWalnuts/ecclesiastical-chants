Various liturgical resources set in Gregorian Chant notation.

## Overview
This is an on-going project to gather various liturgical resources together and
to notate them using Gregorian chant notation, and to format them in such a way
that others can:
1. Use them in their own documents.
2. Edit them for their own use.

The goal will be to have modern and traditional language texts set to the same
chant tones. Ideally there will be parity between the language types, but we
will see.

## Resources
- [2019 Book of Common Prayer](https://bcp2019.anglicanchurch.net/): Modern
language resources taken from here.
- [Sing The Office](https://singtheoffice.com/): Traditional Anglican Morning,
Evening, and Compline offices pointed for chanting.
- [St. Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter](https://andrewespress.com/st-dunstans-plainsong-psalter-hardcover/):
Helpful essays about Lesson tones, Collect tones, and various other chanting
topics.
- [The Gregorio Project](http://gregorio-project.github.io/index.html): TeX
styling for Gregorian Chant Engraving. This makes the whole project possible.
- [Illuminare Score Editor](https://editor.sourceandsummit.com/legacy/): online
tool for converting the gabc files to PDFs of engraved Gregorian Chant. This is
really helpful if you don't know how to use TeX.

## Current State
I haven't gotten around to teaching myself TeX, so all I do currently is use
the Illuminare Score Editor to convert blocks of text to gabc notation and save
those once they appear to be in good working order. Therefore, at this time, if
anyone wishes to use these gabc files, they will need to use a tool like
Illuminare to convert them into the actual chant notation. For more details
about what to do here, please see the docs for [The Gregorio Project](http://gregorio-project.github.io/index.html).

## Future State
- Teach myself TeX, so that I can generate my own PDFs of the engraved chants.
I would include these in the repo, so it would be a lot easier for someone to
just grab a file and use it, rather than having to build the PDF themselves.
- If there is a way to automate the builds of the PDFs using Github Actions,
that would be pretty awesome as well.
- More and more content.

## In Fine
If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to brush up on
Gregorio and open a Pull Request. I am happy to collaborate.
